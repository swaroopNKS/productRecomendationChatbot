1.Open the .ipynb file in the Colab.
2.Get your API Token and Environment from the Pinecone.
3.Get the Access token from the Huggingface. And the request the model "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf" from meta. As it is private repository.
4.Once meta approves the access then download the model or directly access the model from the Huggingface once the approve was given.
5.Replace the api keys and tokens and run the cells.
